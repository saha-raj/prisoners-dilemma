# Project Guidelines

## Project Goals
- Create a web-based Prisoner's Dilemma tournament visualization
- Run entirely in the browser (client-side)
- Allow users to select competing strategies and their proportions
- Visualize elimination-style tournaments until dominance or equilibrium

## Collaboration Rules

### Development Approach
- Keep implementations simple and straightforward
- Favor readability over cleverness
- Use vanilla JavaScript for simulation logic
- Use D3.js for visualizations without unnecessary abstractions

### Process Guidelines
- Wait for explicit approval before making code changes
- Look for clear signals like "go ahead," "proceed," or "implement this"
- Do not implement features that haven't been requested
- Ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. 
- DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE OR OVERENGINEER SOLUTIONS.

### Code Standards
- Maintain clean, well-commented code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Implement only what's needed - no speculative features
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Provide explanations for implementation decisions when needed

### Feature Priorities
1. Core prisoner's dilemma game mechanics
2. Tournament simulation logic
3. Basic visualization of agents and pairings
4. Interactive controls for strategy selection and parameters
5. Statistics display and results visualization
